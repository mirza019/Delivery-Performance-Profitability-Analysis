## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of four CSV files:

1. **data_deliveries.csv**: Main transactional data about package deliveries
2. **data_drivers.csv**: Information about delivery drivers
3. **data_warehouses.csv**: Details about company warehouses
4. **data_zones.csv**: Information about delivery zones
